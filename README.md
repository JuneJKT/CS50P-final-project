# Find Your Lucky Pathway (Astrology)

#### Video Demo:  <URL https://youtu.be/rtNMevW3UPo>

#### Description:
"Find Your Lucky Pathway" is a Python-based astrology project designed to calculate an individual's lucky pathway based on their birthdate, birth time, and birth place. The application generates a personalized prophecy using astrological data and provides an option to create a PDF prophecy card for the user.

By analyzing birth charts and programming patterns, we can uncover fascinating connections between astrological influences and programming outcomes. Python allows us to run complex algorithms and statistical analysis, providing valuable insights into the correlation between planetary positions and coding patterns. This integration offers a unique perspective on how celestial forces may shape our coding journeys and uncover our fortunate pathways.

#### Features
**Personalized Lucky Pathway Calculation:**
Utilizes birthdate, birth time, and birth place to compute an individual's lucky pathway. This feature incorporates formulas to calculate the ascendant sign of an individual using the positions of the sun and moon based on the date, time, and place of birth. Once we obtain the ascendant, we proceed to calculate the position of the 'Part of Fortune' using the formulas 'Ascendant - Sun + Moon' for individuals born during the day, and 'Ascendant - Sun + Moon' for those born at night. Subsequently, we determine the zodiac sign of the Part of Fortune.

**Prophecy Generation:**
Generates a personalized prophecy based on the astrological data provided.

**PDF Prophecy Card Creation:**
Offers the functionality to create a PDF prophecy card for easy sharing or printing.

#### Usage
1. Run the application: project.py
2. Input your birthdate, birth time, and birth place as prompted.
3. Follow the instructions to generate your personalized prophecy and create a PDF prophecy card.

**Example**
```
python project.py
Enter your birthdate (YYYY-MM-DD): 1990-05-20
Enter your birth time (HH:MM in 24-hr format): 09:30
Enter your birth place (e.g. New York City): New York City
```

#### Please Note...
These prophecies are symbolic and open to interpretation. They aim to provide guidance and inspiration rather than a deterministic outlook. Trust in your unique journey and intuition as you navigate the path toward your fortune.

However, due to limitations in Python programming tools, calculating complex astrological positions might be slightly misleading.

Also, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of astrology as a predictive tool and understand the responsibility of providing accurate and reliable information to users. Please use this program JUST FOR FUN.
